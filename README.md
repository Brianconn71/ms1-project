# Manson Avenue

My project for Milestone 1 of the Code Institute full stack developer course is on a fictitious band called Manson Avenue.

I decided to do my project on a fictitious band, Manson Avenue, beacuse I have a een interest in music and there are a lot of singers and bands thats don't have great websites. So, I decided to make my own.
The band name, photos [found on](www.unsplash.com), and any information I have displayed on the website is entirely fictitious.
