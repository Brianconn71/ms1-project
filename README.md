# Manson Avenue

My project for Milestone 1 of the Code Institute full stack developer course is on a fictitious band called Manson Avenue.

I decided to do my project on a fictitious band, Manson Avenue, beacuse I have a keen interest in music and there are a lot of singers and bands thats don't have great websites. So, I decided to make my own.
The band name, photos [Unsplash](www.unsplash.com), and any information I have displayed on the website is entirely fictitious.

I wanted to achieve a minimalist website design so as to encourage newcomers to get involved and 
also to give current fans a way to communicate directly with the band.


## Table of Contents


# UX

### Description

This project was undertaken based on some personal inspiration I had based on the fact that a lot of musicians websites are quite clunky, hard to manouver and there is always a sense that there is too much going on. I wanted to implement a minimalist stye
that appeals to new fans and old fans. 

The main Nav bar at the top of the page will be fixed and should stay at the top of the page as a user scrolls so to make for much easier 
navigation. I wanted to adhere to consistency so I had a main hero image across all pages with a carosel of pictures from the band
on the about us page. The footer remains consistent throught the website.

## Strategy

### Manson Avenue Goals/Objectives

* "We want to make it easy for fans, businesses and agencies to find us and to contact us through the site"

* "We want to sell more of our merchandise"

* "We want current fans to see our concert schedule and we want new fans to see where our next concerts will be so they can come and see us play"


### User Stories

* "I want to be able to contact Manson Avenue"

* "I want to be able to see and possibly purchase some band merchandise for myself or as 
a present"

* "I want to see when and where there next concert is"

* "I have an event, I need a band, I want to book Manson Avenue for a gig, How do I contact them?"

## Scope

### Features

#### Website Overall

The overall website will have 3 pages, across the three pages will be the same navbar and footer.
The header will be consistent across all pages although the home page and the contact us page will have a main hero image while the About us page 
will have a carosel of images.

There will be Call to action buttons on each page and the navbar at the top of the page will be the main source of navigation throughout the website.


#### Home page

The Home page will consist of:

* A navbar at the top of the page which will be used consistenty throughout the website as the main source of navigation.

* A main hero image which will show a picture of Manson avenue playing a concert with lots of fans watching them.
I chose a minimalist pic that I feel really stands out and gives a new fan a real taste of what they can expect from Manson Avenue.

* There will then be 2 CTAs on the main hero image, one which will link to the band merchandise section and another 
which will take a user to the contact us page where they can directly contact Manson Avenue.

* Below the main hero image I will have 2 reviews from fans of the band. Again this is another chance to encourage new fans to come along to a concert or buy some merchandise and 
it also gives current fans a chance to appear on the website.

* Then I will have the Band merchandise section, the CTA in the main hero image will link to this, This section will allow fans new and cureent to purchasetickets to shows, CDs and 
clothing on sale from Manson Avenue. This feature will benefit the band and also build lifetime fans who want to have a piece of the bands memorabilia.

* The footer at the bottom of the page will be coonsistent throughout the website, It will contain the social media links to the social media profiles
of Manson Avenue.

#### About Us page

The About us page will consist of:

* A navbar at the top of the page which will be used consistenty throughout the website as the main source of navigation.

* There will then be a carosel of 5 images, these will be images of the band and some of there concerts 
and showing the fans enjoying themselves at the concerta this will create a positive impression for newcomers aiming to know as much as they can about the band.

* Then there will be three questions that a new fan may want to know such as Who are Manson Avenue and Where did it all begin? These questions will have answers underneath the headings.
This is important as it tells a new fan all they want to know about Manson Avenue and will help them to relate to the band.

* Then there will be another CTA which will allow new fans to contact the band should they want to find out more about the band that hasn't been answered or allow them to just directly message the band through the contact form.

* Then there is a Band Members section which will include pictures of the band members and also give some basic information about each band member such as Name age and an interesting fact.
This will again allow fans to relate to the band and let them see there personality.

* The footer at the bottom of the page will be coonsistent throughout the website, It will contain the social media links to the social media profiles
of Manson Avenue.

#### Contact Us page

The Contact Us page will consist of:

* A navbar at the top of the page which will be used consistenty throughout the website as the main source of navigation.

* The header will be an image of a microphone so as to give fans the sense of being handed a microphone on stage with the band.
The header will contain some text of instructions in where to fill out the contact form and how to get in touch. A minimalist design 
to make it easier and much more straight forward to understand what the page is used for.

* The contact form will then be displayed below that which will allow a fan user to enter there name and email along with there message or request for the band.

* Below that, There will be a Submit button which will allow a fan to snd there message or request to the band.

* The footer at the bottom of the page will be coonsistent throughout the website, It will contain the social media links to the social media profiles
of Manson Avenue.

### Future Features/Improvements

* A blog which would allow Band members to post stories and for the band to announce new tour dates etc.

* A cart, checkout and payment system to allow fans to purchase tickets and merchandise on the website.

## Structure

I decided to split the website up into three different pages with each page having a key role to play in the overall look and feel of the site.

The home page is the landing page of the site, It is the page that a user will first land on. I have two clear Call To Action buttons on the main hero image on the 
home page which immediately shows the user the two main things that they could want to do on the site. The first thing is to contact the band regarding a potential concert or a general query and the second CTA directs them to the merchandise section on the home page allowing
them to browse the items for sale and make a purchase.

The Navbar and the footer are consistent throughout the Website so as to allow familiarity for the users.
I have laid out the homepage in order of the importance of the content. Some reviews of the band are put under the hero image of the home page so as to allow fans to have their say and for them to feel importance and also to allow new and potential fans 
to get a feel from those in the know if they too will like Manson Avenue.

The band Merchandise section on the home page allows for fans to purchase some band memorabilia and allows Manson Avenue to showcase their work.

The Concert schedule is last on the home page as it is of lesser importance to every other section but it would be of more use to a regular and long term fan who has already been on the website before and knows about the band and just wants to check 
when and where Manson Avenue are playing next.

The about Us page is a page of vital importance for the band to get some new fans and to relate to there fans. 
The page again is structured in line of importance. The first section answers some very basic questions that fans of the band may have such as who they are and where they began. There is then a CTA allowing for users to be taken to the Contact us page.
After reading the basic questions and answers I felt that many users may want to know more about the band or even just want to send a good luck message or possibly book them for a performance so it is here I put the CTA.
Below that I have a section labelled Band Members. This section just gives a very small insight into the band with the hopes that they can relate with their fans.

The conatct us page is laid out as minimalistic as I could have done. My main reason for this is because once Manson Avenue get a fan or user this far, the transition into a potential customer needs to be quci
and painless for them.

The Header will include a picture of a microphone so as to giving their fans a feel of being part of the band.
I also have some text on the header so as to make it very clear what I want a user to do once they get to this page and 
that is to fill out the contact form below and submit it.

The contact form will include a field to enter their name, email address and a message or query that the user may have for the band.

## Surface

The Surface plane of the website is all about the visual representation of the information dislayed. It was important for me to keep a consistent
"smoky" theme to the website. I modelled the band around a kind of Indie rock band. Indie Rock always gives a feel of "smokiness" or edginess.
I wanted to maintain a consistent dark theme with bright CTA buttons and make sure the writing on the website had easy readability.

### Color

The main colors used throughout the project are as follows:

* #1C304A is the background color for the Navbar and footer and in certain sections throughout the website. It is a dark blue, gray kind of color which goes well with my overall theme.
* #E5E5E5 is the color of the font on the website which I feel goes well with the dark background.
* #02C8F6 is the main button color. It is a bright blue which both complements the dark background and stands out too.

### Images 

The images have all been taken from [Unsplash](www.unsplash.com) and are credited in the credits section.
These images are primarily dark to go with the theme of the website.

### Fonts

There are two fonts in use throughout the website. The main heading font is [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=monts) and the paragraph writing and sub text is [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=robo).
The default font will also be sans-serif.

I chose these fonts as they complement each other very well and have easy readability for users.

### Content

* The idea for the website was my own. I wanted to make a nice, simple, minimalist design for a bands webpage.
However, I did get some inspiration for media querys and overall how to make an attractive responsive website from Gary Simon
on YouTube and his fantastic video which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gNrZ4lAnAw&list=LL&index=13&t=3058s&ab_channel=DesignCourse).
