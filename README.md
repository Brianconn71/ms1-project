# Manson Avenue

My project for Milestone 1 of the Code Institute full stack developer course is on a fictitious band called Manson Avenue.

I decided to do my project on a fictitious band, Manson Avenue, beacuse I have a keen interest in music and there are a lot of singers and bands thats don't have great websites. So, I decided to make my own.
The band name, photos [Unsplash](www.unsplash.com), and any information I have displayed on the website is entirely fictitious.

I wanted to achieve a minimalist website design so as to encourage newcomers to get involved and 
also to give current fans a way to communicate directly with the band.

### Description

This project was undertaken based on some personal inspiration I had based on the fact that a lot of musicians websites are quite clunky, hard to manouver and thereis always a sense that there is too much going on. I wanted to implement a minimalist stye
that appeals to new fans and old fans. 

The main Nav bar at the top of the page will be fixed and should stay at the top of the page as a user scrolls so to make for much easier 
navigation. I wanted to adhere to consistency so I had a main hero image across all pages with a carosel of pictures from the band
on the about us page. The footer remains consistent throught the website.

## Strategy

### Manson Avenue Goals/Objectives
